* Check validity under the following circumstances:

  - Removing all inputs and/or outputs (may segfault?)

* When a configuration is loaded, channels are sorted in
  alphabetical order. This can be different from the order
  in which they were added, resulting in saved elements
  obscuring or being partly obscured by others. Layout order
  of inputs and outputs should be preserved.

* Renaming of inputs and outputs (because deleting and recreating
  them causes elements to disappear and be replaced by simple
  knobs)
