Installation
------------


To install JackMix you basicly need to do:
 scons

JackMix requires Qt4.2 or higher, the jack-audio-connection-kit
version 0.100.0 or higher and lash-1 version 0.5.1 or higher.
As of v 0.5.0 it also requires libasound (the alsa library) version 2
for MIDI signal routing.

Currently the buildsystem doesn't install the binary to some
extra place. If you want it to be installed, just copy jackmix/jackmix
to your destination of choice.

If you run into any other problems don't hesitate to contact me at
arnold@arnoldarts.de or on linux-audio-user@lists.linuxaudio.org.
Problems involving the MIDI control of the mixer are almost certainly
Nick Bailey's fault: nick@n-ism.org is the place to contact him.
