Installation
------------


To install JackMix you basicly need to do:
 scons

JackMix requires Qt4.2 or higher, the jack-audio-connection-kit version 0.100.0 or higher and lash-1 version 0.5.1 or higher.

Currently the buildsystem doesn't install the binary to some extra place. If you want it to be installed, just copy jackmix/jackmix to your destination of choice.

If you run into any other problems don't hesitate to contact me at arnold@arnoldarts.de or on linux-audio-user@lists.linuxaudio.org.
